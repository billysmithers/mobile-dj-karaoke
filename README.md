# Mobile DJ Karaoke

An HTML 5 / JS Karaoke player for CDG zip files.

The player part is taken from [CDGPlayer](https://github.com/cutterbl/CDGPlayer). Credit to cutterbl for that.

You can select multiple zip files and add them to a playlist.

## Roadmap

* Use mp3 tags for playlist display
* Reorder playlist
* Remove items from playlist
* Use File System Access API (fallback to File Reader) to allow directory selection and NAS support
* UI for browsing and searching music (using the File System Access API and IndexedDB).
